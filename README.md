## Description

I used the connectivity_plus package to monitor the user's network status and determine if they are online or offline. This package allowed me to check the type of connection (Wi-Fi, mobile data, or none) and listen for real-time connectivity changes. Based on this, I was able to show appropriate messages or handle data fetching only when an active internet connection was available. This ensures a smoother user experience by managing network-dependent features effectively.
